## 1. Assess situation

<p> A supervisor of a court clerk had difficulties monitoring the daily productivity of employees. The system provided by the court only issued files in excel format with the tasks performed by each employee. </p>

## 2. Solution

<p> A python code was developed to extract data from the Court system on employee productivity and allow it to be easily updated.</p>
<p> The extracted data were integrated into Power BI, where a dashboard was created to monitor the tasks performed in the last 7 days by the employees, as in the image above.</p>
